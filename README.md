# ShapesLib
Simple 2D Shapes Library written in C++ used in conjunction with SFML

## Installation
You're on your own for this one. I'm not going to write a tutorial on how to install SFML. If you don't know how to install SFML, then you probably shouldn't be using this library.

Think of this as more of a simple example of how to use SFML to create simple 2D shapes.
